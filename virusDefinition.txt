What the virus does:
	1. Masquerades as 'Everyones favourite program' and can be downloaded from the net 
	2. Hides a keylogger in a random folder 
	3. Hides a script that sends the data to a server and sets it to send every minute
	4. Executes the keylogger in the background (it is even hidden from the jobs command)
	5. Copies itself to the bottom of other shell files, so that if run, they will re-install the keylogger
	6. Steals the users root password and the hashes of all their passwords. Adds these to the log
